2007-02-09 : 1.7 beta1 release
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are happy to release this intermediate version with several key improvements to soapUI functionality.
		
* Support for Mocking of WebServices from within soapUI. Mock Services can be run either from inside soapUI 
or with one of the IDE/Maven/CommandLine plugins.This opens for a number of usage scenarios, including:
- Rapid Prototyping of WebServices; generate a complete static mock implementation from a WSDL in seconds 
and add dynamic functionality using Groovy.
- Client testing/development; create mock implementations of desired operations set up a number of 
sample responses (including attachments and custom http-headers) so clients can be developed/tested without 
access to the "live" services. Responses can be cycled, randomized or selected with XPath expression from 
incoming request
- Test-Driven Development; Create soapUI TestSuites/TestCases against MockServices before/during the actual
services have been/are being implemented
* New/Improved Tool Integrations for JBossWS "wsimport" and Oracle wsa
* Improved WSDL-inspector shows tree/outline view over complete contract with "drill-down" functionality
* SSL-inspection shows peer certifacte information for responses received using https
* Generate TestSuite action to generate a complete TestSuite for all operation in an interface
* Improved property-expansion allows XPath expression directly in property-expansion syntax
* New Not-SOAP-Fault assertion
* Possibility to expand received MTOM attachments for schema compliance
* Possibility to override attachment Content-IDs
* Possibility to add default schemas for validation
* Possibility to run WS-I validations using commandline tools
* Possibility to set log-tabs history
* Many more minor improvements and bug-fixes

As always, please make backups of your project files before testing and let us know if you have any issues!

2006-11-12 : 1.6 final release
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are extremely happy to finally release soapUI 1.6 final which introduces a large number of 
fixes and many minor improvements since the beta2 release, including;

* Added exclusion list to proxy settings (comma-seperated)
* Added 2 context properties available when load-testing:
- ThreadIndex : the index of the created thread... this value will never change for a given TestCase during its run time.. 
New threads will simply get an incremented index... the mod of this value could for example be used as an index into a data-file 
(to handle changes in number of threads) 
- RunCount: tells how many times the TestCase has been run by its thread (not in total) during the current LoadTest 
* Added initial support for unzipping gzipped response messages, ie messages with a Content-Type or Content-Encoding ending with "gzip". 
Thanks to Diego Banda.
* Added request-level property to inline attachment content in response editor (as in soapUI 1.5)
* Improved saving of projects to not corrupt files on out-of-memory (saving now first saves to an in-memory buffer
which is written to file if no errors occur..)
* Fixed validation of derived types in xml-editors
* Fixed automatic adding of TestStep Status assertion to newly created loadtests,
* Added option to ignore case in Contains/NotContains assertions
* Improved support for automatic validation by adding an option to not send invalid requests 
* Added support for automatic validation of request/response messages in editors  
thanks to Michael Vorburger! ("Preferences / UI Settings / Validate Request / Response")
* Added support for generating rpc-parts for attachments ("Preferences / WSDL Settings / Attachment Parts")
* Added [Tools] button to all Tools dialogs which opens "Preferences / Integrated Tools" for setting tool paths
* General dialog improvements; Escape closes and F1 shows online help if available
* Fixed validation of SOAP mustUnderstand/encodingStyle attributes in entire messages
* Added possibility to edit response message and revalidate with Alt-V (including assertions)
* Added possibility for custom background image in desktop. Just place a soapui-background.gif/jpg/png in the 
soapUI bin directory (at last :-), Thanks to Roger Sundberg
* Added option to open TestCase editor when adding requests to a TestCase
* Updated to commons-ssl-0.3.0.jar
* Fixed caching of attachments to now be saved in the soapui-project file (compressed)... this makes
portability of soapui-projects with attachments much simpler... The attachment-folder setting has been
removed.
* Fixed property-expansion when running xpath-assertions and property-transfers from within their
editors.
* Fixes password-input fields to be masked

------------------------------------------
This is the first public release and I'm sure there will problems related to 
WSDL importing, XML Validation, etc. (soapUI has been tested rather extensively
only with doc/literal services in a J2EE environment and running under WinXP). 

Please have patience and notify me any problems together with WSDL's, messages, 
project-files, etc. so these can be fixed as soon as possible. Thanks!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Get started by running one of the soapUI scripts in the bin folder..

Good Luck and happy soaping!
