		<section name="SOAP Monitor Coverage">
		<p>When enabling <a href="../coverage.html">WSDL Coverage</a> for a SOAP Monitor, soapUI will 
		continuously accumulate and analyze monitored requests and add their coverage to the Coverage Panel. This can be
		used in many situations, for example:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>If you are running manual tests and want to see how much these cover, you can run these through a SOAP Monitor and
		analyze the results.</li>
		<li>If you want to see the actual utilization of a contract in a testing or live environment.</li>
		<li>etc...</li>
		</ul>
		<p>When collecting coverage for a SOAP Monitor, the Coverage Panel only contains the Interface-related part
		of the Coverage Tree, since no TestSuites/TestCases are applicable during this analysis;</p>
