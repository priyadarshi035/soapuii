		<section name="MockService Coverage">

		<p>When enabling <a href="../coverage.html">Coverage for a MockService</a> , soapUI will 
		continuously accumulate and analyze mock requests or responses and add their coverage to the Coverage Panel. This
		collects the following 2 measurements:</p>
		
		<ul>
		<li>Client Coverage : how much of the WSDL contract that your client is actually submitting.</li>
		<li>Mock Coverage : how much of the contract your Mock is actually mocking</li>
		</ul>
		<p>When collecting coverage for a MockService, the Coverage Panel contains the Interface-related part
		of the Coverage Tree and the containing MockService and its MockOperations; under each MockOperation the 
		actual exchanged messages are shown.</p>
