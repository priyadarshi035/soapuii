		If you'd like to see the actual entire messages sent, soapUI provide the Raw View Editor. 
		This will show the Raw, unadultered message; headers included.

		The purpose of the Raw Editor is for you making sure that what you see in the other editors is what actually was sent, 
		and providing an alternative way of seeing headers. Remember, you can still see headers by clicking the Headers Inspector 
		button below the messages.
