		 <p>
		Installing soapUI on Windows is either very easy or pretty straightforward depending on which installation you use.<br/> 
		If you use the installer you can just let it run.
		If you use the binary zip there are a few things you should think of:
		</p>
		<ol>
		<li>Download the zip</li>
		<li>Extract to a place you prefer, for example the Applications folder</li>
		<li>Go to the soapUI-1.7.6/bin folder</li>
		<li>There is a file called soapui.sh there, rename it to soapui.sh.command. The Mac will warn, since renaming the file will make the file runnable, but don't worry; that is exactly what we want.</li>
		<li>Open a terminal: It is in Applications/Terminal</li>
		<li>In the Terminal window, navigate to the [soapUI installation]/bin folder</li>
		<li>We want to make sure our soapui.sh.command file is executable so we need to chmod it, write "chmod 544 soapui.sh.command"</li> 
		<li>Now you can start soapUI simply by double clicking soapui.sh.command</li>
		<li>You can even drag it to the dock for Quick Start</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
		<b><i>Please note the following:</i></b><br/>
		You need Java 1.6 to run soapUI on the Mac.
