        minor features improvements and a general overhaul of the UI itself (which will be continuously improved in coming releases). 
        Updated plugins for <a href="intellij/index.html">IntelliJ</a> 
		and <a href="netbeans/index.html">NetBeans 5.5</a>, <a href="plugin/index.html">Maven 1.X/2.X</a> and
		<a href="eclipse/index.html">eclipse</a> are also available.</p>

		<p>The most notable improvements to both soapUI and soapUI Pro are described below.</p>

		<subsection name="New and Noteworthy">
		
			<newfeature img="images/176/interfaceendpoints.gif" alt="interface pop up menu default username password for soa test">
				<div>The "Service Endpoints" dialog shown from the Interface popup menu now allows association 
				of default username/password/domain/WSS-Type/WSS-TimeToLive for an endpoint, removing the requirement 
				to enter these at the request/test-request level. [<a href="userguide/interfaces/endpoints.html">Read More</a>]</div>
			</newfeature>
			
			<newfeature img="images/176/testrunnerdialog.gif" alt="launch command line for soa test">
			<div>Launch dialog for the soapUI command-line TestCaseRunner makes it easy to explore command-line options, 
			generate launch commands and see the results for command-line execution. soapUI Pro includes an option to 
			open generated reports directory in a browser. [<a href="userguide/commandline/functional.html#Launch_Dialog">Read More</a>]</div>
			</newfeature>

			<newfeature img="images/176/loadtestrunnerdialog.gif" alt=" load test runner for soa test">
			<div>Launch dialog for the soapUI command-line LoadTestRunner makes it easy to explore command-line options, 
			generate launch commands and see the results for command-line execution. [<a href="userguide/commandline/loadtest.html#Launch_Dialog">Read More</a>]</div>
			</newfeature>
			
			<newfeature img="images/176/apachecxf.gif" alt="Apche CXF stubsfor soap test">

				<div>Improved Groovy/xml editors with line-numbers, right-button menus, etc..</div>
			</newfeature>

			<newfeature>
				<div>Projects can now be closed / opened in a Workspace from the Projects popup ("Close/Open Project") and 
				Workspace popup ("Close/Open all... Projects"). Closed projects are displayed with a grey 
				project-icon and can be opened either via their right-button menu or by simply double-clicking 
				them. Closed projects will not be loaded from disk and will thus greatly improve startup times 
				and reduce memory consumption. [<a href="userguide/workspaces.html">Read More</a>]</div>
			</newfeature>

			<newfeature img="images/176/recentmenu.gif" alt="file and recent menu for soa test">

			</newfeature>
			
			<newfeature img="images/176/postprocess.gif" alt="check and post process soa test">
			<div>A number of actions currently update a number of target items (TestRequests, etc.). It may be required 
			to manually check/post-process these after such an operation and they have been extended with an option to 
			open a list of the modified items in a separate window which can be used for post-processing/navigating to 
			changed items.</div>
			</newfeature>
			
			<newfeature>
				<div>Improved MTOM functionality;</div>
				<ul>
				<li>MTOM will now be used for all binary content when MTOM is enabled, 
				even if the corresponding XML Schema datatype and/or the content element is missing any of the xmime 
				related attributes.</li>
				<li>A new "Force MTOM" request level property which will result in the corresponding message always 
				being sent with MTOM, even if there is no binary content. This is to mimic the behavior of many web 
				service toolkits and servers.</li>
				<li>Improved MTOM support in MockServices</li>
				</ul>
				<div>[<a href="userguide/attachments.html#MTOM_Attachments">Read More</a>]</div>
			</newfeature>

				<div>Global/System-Property expansion support in property expansions: Specifying a 
				-Dsoapui.properties=..properties-file.. option at startup will load these properties 
				and make them globally available in property-expansions using a ${##property.name} syntax. If the property
				is not found or no properties-file has been specified, the corresponding system property will be 
				returned instead (if available). [<a href="userguide/properties.html#Property_Expansion">Read More</a>]
				</div>
			</newfeature>
	
			<newfeature>
			<div>Added a "Max Assertion Errors" setting to LoadTest options that discards "old" assertion errors to 
			preserve memory. [<a href="userguide/loadtest/index.html#LoadTest_Options">Read More</a>]</div>
			</newfeature>
			
			<newfeature>
			    <div>A large number of general UI/Usability improvements;</div>
			    <ul>
			    <li>Replaced tabs with "inspectors" in most places for easier/cleaner UI</li>
			    <li>Streamlined editor windows to always have a toolbar/editor/inspectors top-down layout</li>
			    <li>Created toolbars/buttons instead of text-buttons in most editors</li>
			    <li>Fixed tabbing/F1-help in dialogs</li>
			    <li>Simplified project creation does not require saving of projects on creation</li>
			    <li>Import of global settings when starting a new installation (see below for extended support in soapUI Pro)</li>

			[<a href="userguide/commandline/loadtest.html">Read More</a>]</div>
			</newfeature>
			
			<newfeature>
				<div>Initial steps towards a plug-in/extension API, currently allowing easy additions of custom menu-actions
				and internal listeners. In soapUI Pro these can be created in Groovy in the global script library with run-time
				recompile support (ie no need to restart soapUI Pro to test changed extensions). This will be much improved to provide
				a full-fledged extension-API in a future version. Thanks to Philippe Marsteau for contributing/providing feedback! 
				[<a href="architecture/extensions.html">Read More</a>]
				</div>
			</newfeature>
			
			<newfeature>

				<li><code>XmlHolder.getNamespaces()</code> - returns a Map of prefixes to namespace URI:s that will 
				be used in XPath expressions</li>
				<li><code>XmlHolder.removeDomNodes( XPath )</code> - removes all DOM nodes matching the specified
				XPath expression</li>
				</ul>
			</newfeature>
			
			<newfeature>
			<div>As always, a number of SourceForge feature requests and bugs have been fixed:</div>
			<ul>
			<li>Option to discard properties</li>
			<li>Much-improved support for one-way operations</li>
			<li>Property Expansion is now supported in Conditional Goto Steps XPath</li>
			<li>Fixed save of empty properties in Properties Step</li>
			<li>Fixed URL decoding of WSDL port locations</li>
			<li>Fixed correct setting of SOAPAction / Content-Type headers for SOAP 1.2</li>
			<li>MockService fault with HTTP response code 500</li>
			<li>Generate TestSuite does not use existing Requests</li>
			<li>OutOfMemory error when creating backup requests</li>
			</ul>

			<newfeature>
			<div>And of course a large number of bugs, issues, etc. have been fixed thanks
