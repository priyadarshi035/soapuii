		<section name="soapUI IntelliJ Plugin">
		<p>The soapUI IntelliJ Plugin provides all soapUI functionality directly from within 
		<a target="_new" href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a> allowing one integrated development and 
		testing environment for Web Services in Java.</p>
        <p>Existing soapUI desktop components are made available through two ToolWindows:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>A "soapUI Navigator" ToolWindow at the left contains the 
		<a href="../userguide/overview.html#Navigator_Tree_Model">soapUI Workspace Navigator</a> and Details Tab</li>
		<li>A "soapUI Log" ToolWindow at the bottom contains the same 
		<a href="../userguide/overview.html#Log_Tabs">Log Tabs</a> as in soapUI</li>
		</ul>
		<p>All soapUI Desktop Panels are made available as editor tabs in IDEA and will be opened and closed as usual. Here 
		are some screenshots:</p>

		<p>Currently, the plugin can be seen as a "level 1" integration, i.e. it is "merely" a packaging of soapUI 
		components in the IntelliJ environment.</p>	
		
		<subsection name="soapUI Intellij Plugin Installation">
		
		<p>Since IntelliJ 8, a direct link for installing the soapUI IntelliJ plugin is available in the Tools/Web Services menu.
        Is is also downloadable from SourceForge and through IntelliJ&apos;s plugin-manager. After installing, you should increase IntelliJ&apos;s PermGen space
		as the plugin requires a fair amount of memory; do this by altering the idea.exe.vmoptions file in the idea 
		bin directory to for example:</p>
		<source>-Xms128m
-Xmx512m
-XX:MaxPermSize=128m
-ea</source>

		<subsection name="Getting Started soapUI Tutorial">
		<p>The existing <a href="../gettingstarted/index.html">Getting Started</a> applies also to the IntelliJ Plugin, as does
		the <a href="../userguide/index.html">User Guide</a>. The only real difference is that the standalone soapUI Desktop has
		been replaced by the IntelliJ tabbed interface for editors.</p>
