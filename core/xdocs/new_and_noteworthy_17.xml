		<subsection name="New and Noteworthy in beta1">
		
			<newfeature img="images/mockoverview.gif" alt="mock service for soap testing" width="550">
				<div>Support for Mocking of Web Services directly from within soapUI. 
				Mock Services can be run either from inside soapUI or with one of the IDE/Maven/CommandLine plugins.
				This opens for a number of usage scenarios, including:</div>
				<ul>
					<li>Rapid Prototyping of Web Services; generate a complete static mock implementation from a WSDL in seconds 
					and add dynamic functionality using Groovy.</li>
					<li>Client testing/development; create mock implementations of desired operations and set up a number of 
					alternative responses (including scripts, attachments and custom http-headers). Clients can be developed/tested without 
					access to the "live" services. Responses can be cycled, randomized or selected with XPath expression from 
					incoming request</li>
					<li>Test-Driven Development; Create soapUI TestSuites/TestCases against MockServices before/during the actual
					services have been/are being implemented</li>
					<li>etc..</li>
				</ul>
				<div>
				Read the <a href="gettingstarted/mocking.html">Getting Started with Mocking</a> guide to create your first MockService in 
				seconds (well.. almost..)
				</div>

			<newfeature img="images/new_jbossws_jaxws.gif" alt="soa test new tool intergration for JBoss svn">
				<div>New Tool Integration for JBossWS "wsimport" (requires JBoss 5.0 beta2 from jboss svn)</div>
			</newfeature>
			
			<newfeature img="images/new_oracle_wsa.gif" alt="soa testing integration for oracle wsa.jar utility">
				<div>New Initial Integration for Oracle wsa.jar utility</div>
			</newfeature>
			
			<newfeature img="images/new_wsdl_viewer.gif" alt="soa testing WSDL inspector" width="550">
				<div>Improved WSDL-inspector shows tree/outline view over complete 
				contract with "drill-down" functionality. Single-clicking a node moves to the corresponding position in the 
				declaring/defining file. Double-clicking a node selects the tree-node referred to (if applicable), for example
				double clicking a message part will focus on that parts global element or complex type in the schema.</div>
			</newfeature>
			
			<newfeature img="images/new_ssl_viewer.gif" alt="soa testing SSL inspecrion shows peer certificate iformation" width="550">
				<div>SSL-inspection tab shows peer certificate information for responses received using https</div>
			</newfeature>
			
			<newfeature img="images/new_testsuite_generator.gif" alt="soa test property expansion">
				<div>Generate TestSuite action to generate a complete TestSuite for all operations in an

		    </newfeature>
			
			<newfeature>
			<div>
				Improved property-expansion allows XPath expression directly in property-expansion syntax; for example
				<source>&lt;someTag&gt;${Request1#Response#//ns2:Title/text()}&lt;/someTag&gt;</source>
				would select the ns2:Title/text() from the specified Response property. This functionality can in many cases
				replace simple property-transfers. Also, as you can see, the XPath expression uses the namespace prefixes 
				in the specified property, so namespaces need not be declared (but if the prefixes in the source property 
				the XPath will stop working)</div>
			</newfeature>
			
			<newfeature img="images/new_override_contentids.gif" alt="soa test new over ride content ids">
				<div>Possibility to override attachment Content-IDs (see
